COMPREHENSIVE RISK FACTOR ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
This analysis identifies key risk factors affecting suicide rates, HDI, and GDP
across social, economic, employment, and environmental dimensions.

KEY FINDINGS BY CATEGORY:

SOCIAL FACTORS:
- Education: Higher enrollment correlates with lower suicide rates
- Health: Better health outcomes strongly linked to higher HDI
- Gender: Gender inequality impacts mental health outcomes
- Environment: Environmental factors show complex relationships

ECONOMIC & EMPLOYMENT FACTORS:
- Unemployment: Strong positive correlation with suicide rates
- Economic Structure: Service-based economies correlate with higher HDI
- Inequality: Higher Gini index associated with increased suicide risk
- Stability: Economic instability impacts mental health

2. Proportion of population pushed or further pushed below the $2.15 ($ 2017 PPP) poverty line by out-of-pocket health care expenditure (%): 0.919 (p=0.0000)
3. Proportion of population pushed further below the $3.65 ($ 2017 PPP) poverty line by out-of-pocket health care expenditure (%): 0.783 (p=0.0000)
4. Proportion of population pushed or further pushed below the $3.65 ($ 2017 PPP) poverty line by out-of-pocket health care expenditure (%): 0.712 (p=0.0000)
5. Account ownership at a financial institution or with a mobile-money-service provider, female (% of population ages 15+): 0.590 (p=0.0000)
6. Account ownership at a financial institution or with a mobile-money-service provider, poorest 40% (% of population ages 15+): 0.580 (p=0.0000)

10. Account ownership at a financial institution or with a mobile-money-service provider, older adults (% of population ages 25+): 0.572 (p=0.0000)

PREVENTION RECOMMENDATIONS:
