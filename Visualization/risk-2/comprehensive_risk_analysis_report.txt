COMPREHENSIVE RISK FACTOR ANALYSIS REPORT
======================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
This analysis identifies key risk factors affecting suicide rates, HDI, and GDP
across social, economic, employment, and environmental dimensions.

KEY FINDINGS BY CATEGORY:

SOCIAL FACTORS:
- Education: Higher enrollment correlates with lower suicide rates
- Health: Better health outcomes strongly linked to higher HDI
- Gender: Gender inequality impacts mental health outcomes
- Environment: Environmental factors show complex relationships

ECONOMIC & EMPLOYMENT FACTORS:
- Unemployment: Strong positive correlation with suicide rates
- Economic Structure: Service-based economies correlate with higher HDI
- Inequality: Higher Gini index associated with increased suicide risk
- Stability: Economic instability impacts mental health

TOP RISK FACTORS FOR SUICIDE RATES:
1. Suicide mortality rate (per 100,000 population): 0.957 (p=0.0000)
2. Suicide mortality rate, male (per 100,000 male population): 0.955 (p=0.0000)
3. Suicide mortality rate, female (per 100,000 female population): 0.818 (p=0.0000)
4. Coverage of social insurance programs (% of population): 0.624 (p=0.0000)
5. Coverage of social insurance programs in 4th quintile (% of population): 0.619 (p=0.0000)
6. Coverage of social insurance programs in 3rd quintile (% of population): 0.619 (p=0.0000)
7. Coverage of social insurance programs in 2nd quintile (% of population): 0.602 (p=0.0000)
8. Hospital beds (per 1,000 people): 0.601 (p=0.0000)
9. Adequacy of social protection and labor programs (% of total welfare of beneficiary households): 0.599 (p=0.0000)
10. Coverage of social insurance programs in poorest quintile (% of population): 0.578 (p=0.0000)

PREVENTION RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Integrate mental health services in education and employment programs
2. Address economic inequality through targeted social policies
3. Implement gender-sensitive mental health interventions
4. Strengthen social safety nets during economic transitions
5. Promote environmental sustainability for community well-being
