COMPREHENSIVE RISK FACTOR ANALYSIS REPORT
============================================================

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Development-Risk Patterns:
   - Countries in medium development (HDI 0.55-0.80) show highest suicide risk
   - Very high HDI countries exhibit 'development paradox'
   - Low HDI countries show resilience in some cases

2. Top Correlated Risk Factors:
   - Population ages 15-64 (% of total population): -0.074
   - Urban population (% of total population): -0.072
   - School enrollment, secondary (% gross): -0.044
   - log_GDP_per_capita: -0.044
   - HDI_growth: 0.034
   - Life expectancy at birth, total (years): -0.033
   - HDI: -0.025
   - GDP_per_capita: -0.013
   - Gini index: -0.009
   - Suicide_change: 0.002

3. High-Risk Groups Identified:
   - Countries undergoing rapid development transitions
   - Societies with high income inequality
   - Nations with economic instability
   - Regions with weak mental health infrastructure

4. Prevention Priorities:
   - Target interventions during development transitions
   - Address economic stressors and inequality
   - Strengthen mental health systems
   - Promote social cohesion and safety nets
